        <h1>Order Confirmation | Discount Validation Error</h1>
        <br /><br />
        Hey there! Looks like the Discount Validation came back true, but the Discount Code field was either empty or wrong. Translation: you probably 
        fiddled with the JavaScript to snag yourself a discount without knowing the actual code. Clever moveâ€”except your order wasn't charged, and it's 
        been canceled. Better luck next time!
