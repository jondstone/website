# MiniGallery PHP and JS 

### Inside this folder contains the working files for the Urbex Photo Gallery, seen on the urban exploration pages for my website. [www.jondstone.com](https://www.jondstone.com)
* urbexpage.php (This file contains the PHP code for the above mentioned page(s))
* urbex.css (Contains the CSS for the Gallery)
* urbexgallery.js (Contains the JS for the Gallery)

This code is a hand-written rebuild and refactor for the "Gallery" that is used throughout my Urban Exploration pages. Originally adopted in 2012 using an elastislide plugin, the original code was cumbersome, and often created a lag when viewing photos in the gallery. The code based contained thousands and thousands of lines of code I did not write and was dependent on jQuery.

I rewrote the JavaScript and CSS by hand, and refactored the HTML code to be clean and lightweight and broke the dependency on jQuery. Now the gallery is fast and responsive, and works on mobile and tablet devices.
