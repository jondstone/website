        <h1>Order Confirmation | Discount Validation Error</h1>
        <br /><br />
        Hi! I see the Discount Validation returned true; however the Discount Code field was either null or incorrect. This means you most likely manipulated the JavaScript to give yourself a discount without knowing the code. Your order was not charged and has been cancelled. Nice try!
